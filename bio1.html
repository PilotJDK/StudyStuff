                                Homeostasis is the biological process by which organisms maintain stable internal
                                conditions despite external environmental changes. This regulation keeps critical
                                variables such as body temperature, blood pH, water balance, and glucose concentration
                                within narrow limits that allow enzymes and cells to function properly. Homeostasis
                                operates through feedback loops that involve receptors detecting change, control centers
                                processing that information, and effectors carrying out responses. Negative feedback
                                loops are the most common and counteract change, such as insulin lowering blood sugar or
                                sweating cooling the body. Positive feedback loops, which are less common, amplify
                                change to drive a process to completion, such as oxytocin release during childbirth or
                                the cascade of reactions involved in blood clotting. Failure of homeostatic systems
                                results in disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothermia, or acidosis.

                                Living organisms are built from carbon-based molecules known as biomolecules, which
                                include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbohydrates function
                                primarily as short- and long-term energy sources and structural components. Lipids
                                provide long-term energy storage, insulation, and form the basis of cell membranes
                                through phospholipid bilayers. Proteins, built from amino acids, perform most cellular
                                work including transport, signaling, structure, defense, and chemical reactions. Nucleic
                                acids such as DNA and RNA store and transmit genetic information. These macromolecules
                                are formed by dehydration synthesis and broken down by hydrolysis. The unique chemical
                                properties of water, including polarity and hydrogen bonding, make it essential for the
                                structure and function of these molecules.

                                Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions by lowering the
                                activation energy required for a reaction to occur. Most enzymes are proteins, although
                                some RNA molecules can also act as catalysts. Each enzyme has a specific active site
                                that binds substrates and facilitates their conversion into products. Enzyme activity is
                                highly dependent on temperature and pH, with each enzyme having optimal conditions at
                                which it works best. High temperatures or extreme pH can denature enzymes by disrupting
                                their structure. Enzymes are essential for metabolism and can be regulated by
                                inhibitors, activators, and cofactors to control the rates of biochemical pathways.

                                Cell theory states that all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, that the
