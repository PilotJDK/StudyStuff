                                <strong>Homeostasis</strong>
                                <p class="micro">
                                    Homeostasis is the dynamic process by which multicellular organisms preserve
                                    internal conditions within physiologically acceptable limits despite fluctuations in
                                    the external environment. This constant regulation allows biochemical systems,
                                    particularly enzymes and membrane proteins, to operate efficiently. At the core of
                                    homeostasis are three functional components: sensors that detect internal variables
                                    such as temperature, pH, osmolarity, and blood gas levels; integrative control
                                    centers—primarily neural (hypothalamus, brainstem) and endocrine
                                    (hypothalamic-pituitary axes)—that compare sensor input to biologically-determined
                                    set points and compute appropriate responses; and effectors, including sweat glands,
                                    skeletal muscles, vascular smooth muscle, liver metabolic pathways, and endocrine
                                    glands, which implement corrective actions. For example, thermoregulation is
                                    achieved through heat-loss mechanisms such as vasodilation and evaporative cooling
                                    and heat-conservation mechanisms such as vasoconstriction and shivering
                                    thermogenesis. Blood glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated by pancreatic islet
                                    hormones: insulin promotes cellular uptake and glycogen synthesis in response to
                                    hyperglycemia, whereas glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis during
                                    hypoglycemia. The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis illustrates layered endocrine
                                    negative feedback where rising thyroid hormones suppress upstream releasing and
                                    stimulating hormones to stabilize metabolic rate. Some biological processes use
                                    positive feedback for rapid escalation to a defined endpoint; the classic examples
                                    are the oxytocin-driven contraction cascade during parturition and platelet
                                    activation during thrombosis. Homeostatic control also includes anticipatory
                                    adjustments, such as conditioned salivation and circadian modulation of hormone
                                    release, and relies on redundancy and overlapping pathways to preserve function;
                                    failure or chronic strain on these systems produces pathology, including diabetes
                                    mellitus, heart failure, heat stroke, and acid–base disturbances.

                                <p class="micro">
                                    Biomolecules are organic compounds built primarily from carbon skeletons decorated
                                    with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Their chemistry and
                                    three-dimensional organization produce the functions required for life.
                                    Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides like glucose and fructose to complex
                                    polysaccharides such as glycogen, starch, cellulose, and chitin. Glucose is central
                                    to cellular metabolism; it is catabolized via glycolysis to pyruvate and can enter
                                    aerobic pathways for maximal ATP yield. Structural carbohydrates such as cellulose
                                    differ from storage polymers by their β-glycosidic linkages, which produce straight,
                                    hydrogen-bonded fibrils resistant to most animal digestive enzymes. Lipids form a
                                    chemically diverse group defined by hydrophobicity; triglycerides store dense
                                    chemical energy in adipose tissue, phospholipids self-assemble into bilayers that
                                    create cellular compartments, sterols such as cholesterol modulate membrane fluidity
                                    and serve as precursors for steroid hormones, and waxes protect surfaces from water
                                    loss. Proteins are polymers of twenty canonical amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
                                    The side chain chemistry of amino acids determines local secondary structure such as
                                    α-helices and β-sheets through backbone hydrogen bonding and further drives tertiary
                                    folding through hydrophobic packing, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and
                                    disulfide bridges. Proper folding is critical for function; molecular chaperones
                                    assist folding and protect nascent chains under stress. Nucleic acids—DNA and
                                    RNA—store and transmit genetic information. DNA's antiparallel double helix forms
                                    through complementary base pairing (adenine–thymine via two hydrogen bonds;
                                    cytosine–guanine via three hydrogen bonds) and is stabilized by base stacking
                                    interactions. RNA, with its ribose sugar and uracil base, adopts single-stranded
                                    structures that can fold into catalytic motifs (ribozymes) and mediates translation
                                    (mRNA), tRNA-mediated amino acid delivery, and ribosomal function (rRNA).
                                    Biochemical reactions building polymers proceed by dehydration synthesis, while
                                    hydrolysis returns polymers to monomers; enzymes and regulated pathways catalyze
                                    these transitions. The properties of water—polarity, high heat capacity, cohesion,
                                    adhesion, and solvent capacity—critically influence macromolecular assembly,
                                    reaction rates, and cellular thermoregulation.

                                <strong>Enzymes</strong>
                                <p class="micro">
                                    Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions by stabilizing
                                    transition states and lowering activation energy barriers, thereby increasing
                                    reaction rates without altering reaction equilibria. Although most enzymes are
                                    proteins, some RNA molecules (ribozymes) demonstrate catalytic activity, linking
                                    protein and nucleotide biochemistry. The active site of an enzyme forms a highly
                                    specific microenvironment tailored to bind substrates through complementary shape,
                                    charge, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions; the induced fit model describes
                                    dynamic conformational changes that optimize catalysis. Enzyme kinetics reveal that
                                    reaction velocity rises with substrate concentration until active sites saturate at
                                    a maximum velocity (Vmax); the Michaelis constant (Km) quantitatively reflects
                                    substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity and serves as a comparative measure
                                    of affinity. Enzymes are exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions:
                                    temperature increases kinetic energy and reaction rates up to an optimal point,
                                    after which thermal motion disrupts tertiary structure and causes denaturation; pH
                                    alters protonation states of active-site residues and substrates, thereby modulating
                                    catalysis and binding. Enzymatic activity is regulated on multiple levels including
                                    reversible inhibitors—competitive inhibitors bind the active site and can be
                                    outcompeted by substrate concentration, while noncompetitive inhibitors bind
                                    allosteric sites to reduce catalytic efficiency—covalent modifications such as
                                    phosphorylation that toggle activity states, and availability of cofactors and
                                    coenzymes including metal ions and organic carriers like NAD+ and FAD. Feedback
                                    inhibition, where an end product of a metabolic pathway allosterically inhibits an
                                    upstream enzyme, conserves resources and stabilizes flux. Experimental approaches to
                                    study enzymes include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, Lineweaver–Burk plotting for
                                    parameter estimation, spectrophotometric assays to monitor substrate depletion or
                                    product formation, and mutational analyses to identify catalytic residues.
                                    Representative enzymes include DNA polymerases which add nucleotides in a 5′→3′
                                    direction with high fidelity, kinases which transfer phosphate groups, hydrolases
                                    like lipases that cleave ester bonds, and oxidoreductases such as dehydrogenases
                                    that mediate electron transfers central to respiration and photosynthesis.

                                    Cell theory is a foundational principle in biology stating that all living organisms
                                    are composed of cells, that cells represent the basic structural and functional unit
                                    of life, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division.
                                    This framework unifies diverse biological phenomena, providing an explanatory model
                                    for growth, development, heredity, and tissue maintenance. Cell theory implies that
                                    to understand whole-organism physiology, one must understand cellular components and
                                    interactions, including how cells obtain energy, replicate genetic material, and

                                    Cells are broadly classified into prokaryotic and eukaryotic types based on
                                    organizational complexity. Prokaryotic cells, typified by bacteria and archaea, lack
                                    membrane-bound nuclei and organelles; their genetic material is generally organized
                                    in a nucleoid, and they often possess a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan or
                                    similar polymers, a plasma membrane, ribosomes, and sometimes flagella or pili for
                                    motility and adhesion. Eukaryotic cells contain a true nucleus enveloped by a double
                                    membrane and multiple membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic
                                    reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and—within photosynthetic
                                    lineages—chloroplasts. Eukaryotic compartmentalization allows separation of
                                    incompatible biochemical processes, spatial regulation of metabolism, and more
                                    complex regulation of gene expression. Differences in genome architecture,
                                    replication mechanisms, transcriptional control, and cytoskeletal complexity are

                                    In eukaryotic cells, DNA is not free-floating but is organized into a complex called
                                    chromatin, which allows extremely long DNA molecules to fit inside the nucleus while
                                    still being accessible for transcription and replication. DNA wraps around histone
                                    proteins to form nucleosomes, creating a bead-like structure that coils further into
                                    chromatin fibers. During cell division, chromatin condenses into visible
                                    chromosomes, each consisting of two identical sister chromatids joined at a
                                    centromere. Telomeres, which are repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends,
                                    protect DNA from degradation and prevent chromosomes from fusing together.
                                    Telomerase is an enzyme that can lengthen telomeres in certain cell types such as
                                    stem cells and cancer cells. Changes in chromatin structure through chemical
                                    modifications, such as histone acetylation and methylation, regulate whether genes
                                    are turned on or off.

                                    DNA replication is a highly accurate, semi-conservative process that occurs during
                                    the S phase of interphase. The double helix is unwound by helicase, creating a
                                    replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands and
                                    prevent them from reannealing. Primase synthesizes short RNA primers, providing a
                                    starting point for DNA polymerase III to add complementary DNA nucleotides in the 5′
                                    to 3′ direction. Replication occurs continuously on the leading strand but
                                    discontinuously on the lagging strand, producing Okazaki fragments that are later
                                    joined together by DNA ligase. DNA polymerases also possess proofreading ability,
                                    correcting mismatched bases to maintain genetic stability. Multiple origins of
                                    replication ensure the eukaryotic genome is copied efficiently. Any errors that
                                    escape repair become permanent mutations after the next round of replication.

                                    Mitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell divides its nucleus to produce two
                                    genetically identical daughter nuclei. During prophase, chromatin condenses into
                                    chromosomes and the mitotic spindle begins to form from centrosomes. In metaphase,
                                    chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate, and spindle fibers attach to
                                    kinetochores located at the centromeres. During anaphase, sister chromatids separate
                                    and are pulled toward opposite poles of the cell by shortening spindle fibers.
                                    Telophase follows, during which nuclear membranes reform around each set of
                                    chromosomes and chromosomes begin to decondense. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm
                                    of the cell, forming two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow
                                    forms, while in plant cells, a cell plate develops. Mitosis is essential for growth,

                                    The plasma membrane is described by the fluid mosaic model, which states that the
                                    membrane is composed of a flexible phospholipid bilayer embedded with a mosaic of
                                    proteins. The hydrophilic heads of phospholipids face outward toward water, while
                                    the hydrophobic tails face inward, creating a selective barrier. Integral proteins
                                    span the membrane and function as channels, carriers, or receptors, while peripheral
                                    proteins are attached to the surface and often serve as enzymes or anchors.
                                    Cholesterol molecules help stabilize membrane fluidity in animal cells, preventing
                                    the membrane from becoming too rigid in cold conditions or too fluid in hot

                                    Passive transport moves molecules across membranes without the use of cellular
                                    energy and always occurs from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration.
                                    Simple diffusion allows small, nonpolar molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide
                                    to cross the lipid bilayer directly. Facilitated diffusion uses channel or carrier
                                    proteins to transport ions and polar molecules such as glucose. Osmosis is the
                                    diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane and is often regulated
                                    by aquaporin proteins. Active transport requires ATP to move substances against
                                    their concentration gradient, such as the sodium–potassium pump, which maintains the
                                    electrical balance in nerve and muscle cells. Bulk transport mechanisms, including
                                    endocytosis and exocytosis, allow cells to move large molecules and particles in and

                                    Photosynthesis occurs in two major stages inside chloroplasts. The light-dependent
                                    reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes and use sunlight to excite electrons
                                    in chlorophyll, producing ATP and NADPH and releasing oxygen through the splitting
                                    of water molecules. The light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle,
                                    occur in the stroma and use ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.
                                    Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria and begins with glycolysis in
                                    the cytoplasm, where glucose is broken into pyruvate with the production of a small
                                    amount of ATP. The Krebs cycle and electron transport chain then extract high-energy
                                    electrons to generate large amounts of ATP. Oxygen serves as the final electron
                                    acceptor in aerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, cells perform
                                    fermentation to regenerate NAD+ so glycolysis can continue.

                                    Exponential growth occurs when resources are unlimited, producing a J-shaped growth
                                    curve, while logistic growth occurs when environmental limits slow growth and create

                                    predation, disease, and climate influence population size. Density-dependent factors

                                    given area over time. Primary succession begins on bare rock surfaces where no soil
                                    exists, such as after volcanic eruptions or glacial retreat, while secondary
                                    succession occurs in areas where a disturbance has destroyed a community but left
                                    soil intact. Biomes are large regions characterized by distinct climate conditions
                                    and biological communities, including forests, deserts, grasslands, tundra, and
                                    aquatic ecosystems. Temperature, precipitation, and latitude largely determine biome
                                    distribution.

                                    Transcription begins when RNA polymerase binds to promoter regions such as the TATA
                                    box and synthesizes a complementary RNA strand from the DNA template. In eukaryotes,
                                    the resulting pre-mRNA undergoes modifications including the addition of a 5′ methyl
                                    cap, removal of noncoding introns through splicing, and addition of a poly-A tail.
                                    These modifications protect the mRNA from degradation and help guide it out of the
                                    nucleus and toward ribosomes.

                                    During translation, ribosomes read mRNA codons three nucleotides at a time. Transfer
                                    RNA molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome based on complementary
                                    anticodon pairing. The process begins at the start codon (AUG) and continues until a
                                    stop codon is reached. The sequence of amino acids determines the primary structure
                                    of the protein, which later folds into complex functional shapes. Errors during
                                    translation can cause misfolded or nonfunctional proteins.

                                    Genetic variation arises from mutations, independent assortment, crossing over, and

                                    radiation and chemical exposure or by random errors in DNA replication. While many
                                    mutations are neutral or harmful, some can be beneficial and increase an organism's
                                    ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment.

                                    Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and organisms may be homozygous or
                                    heterozygous for a trait. Punnett squares are used to predict the probability of
                                    different genotypes and phenotypes in offspring.

                                    produces blended traits, codominance allows both alleles to be fully expressed, and
                                    sex-linked traits are often carried on the X chromosome. Environmental factors and

                                    extinct species and transitional forms. Comparing anatomical structures and DNA
                                    sequences allows scientists to infer evolutionary relationships among organisms.
