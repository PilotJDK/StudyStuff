    <div class="subunit" id="u1-s1">
      <strong>Homeostasis</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Homeostasis is the dynamic process by which multicellular organisms preserve internal conditions within physiologically acceptable limits despite fluctuations in the external environment. This constant regulation allows biochemical systems, particularly enzymes and membrane proteins, to operate efficiently. At the core of homeostasis are three functional components: sensors that detect internal variables such as temperature, pH, osmolarity, and blood gas levels; integrative control centers—primarily neural (hypothalamus, brainstem) and endocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary axes)—that compare sensor input to biologically-determined set points and compute appropriate responses; and effectors, including sweat glands, skeletal muscles, vascular smooth muscle, liver metabolic pathways, and endocrine glands, which implement corrective actions. For example, thermoregulation is achieved through heat-loss mechanisms such as vasodilation and evaporative cooling and heat-conservation mechanisms such as vasoconstriction and shivering thermogenesis. Blood glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated by pancreatic islet hormones: insulin promotes cellular uptake and glycogen synthesis in response to hyperglycemia, whereas glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis during hypoglycemia. The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis illustrates layered endocrine negative feedback where rising thyroid hormones suppress upstream releasing and stimulating hormones to stabilize metabolic rate. Some biological processes use positive feedback for rapid escalation to a defined endpoint; the classic examples are the oxytocin-driven contraction cascade during parturition and platelet activation during thrombosis. Homeostatic control also includes anticipatory adjustments, such as conditioned salivation and circadian modulation of hormone release, and relies on redundancy and overlapping pathways to preserve function; failure or chronic strain on these systems produces pathology, including diabetes mellitus, heart failure, heat stroke, and acid–base disturbances.

      <strong>Biomolecules / Macromolecules</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Biomolecules are organic compounds built primarily from carbon skeletons decorated with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Their chemistry and three-dimensional organization produce the functions required for life. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides like glucose and fructose to complex polysaccharides such as glycogen, starch, cellulose, and chitin. Glucose is central to cellular metabolism; it is catabolized via glycolysis to pyruvate and can enter aerobic pathways for maximal ATP yield. Structural carbohydrates such as cellulose differ from storage polymers by their β-glycosidic linkages, which produce straight, hydrogen-bonded fibrils resistant to most animal digestive enzymes. Lipids form a chemically diverse group defined by hydrophobicity; triglycerides store dense chemical energy in adipose tissue, phospholipids self-assemble into bilayers that create cellular compartments, sterols such as cholesterol modulate membrane fluidity and serve as precursors for steroid hormones, and waxes protect surfaces from water loss. Proteins are polymers of twenty canonical amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The side chain chemistry of amino acids determines local secondary structure such as α-helices and β-sheets through backbone hydrogen bonding and further drives tertiary folding through hydrophobic packing, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and disulfide bridges. Proper folding is critical for function; molecular chaperones assist folding and protect nascent chains under stress. Nucleic acids—DNA and RNA—store and transmit genetic information. DNA's antiparallel double helix forms through complementary base pairing (adenine–thymine via two hydrogen bonds; cytosine–guanine via three hydrogen bonds) and is stabilized by base stacking interactions. RNA, with its ribose sugar and uracil base, adopts single-stranded structures that can fold into catalytic motifs (ribozymes) and mediates translation (mRNA), tRNA-mediated amino acid delivery, and ribosomal function (rRNA). Biochemical reactions building polymers proceed by dehydration synthesis, while hydrolysis returns polymers to monomers; enzymes and regulated pathways catalyze these transitions. The properties of water—polarity, high heat capacity, cohesion, adhesion, and solvent capacity—critically influence macromolecular assembly, reaction rates, and cellular thermoregulation.

    <div class="subunit" id="u1-s3">
      <strong>Enzymes</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions by stabilizing transition states and lowering activation energy barriers, thereby increasing reaction rates without altering reaction equilibria. Although most enzymes are proteins, some RNA molecules (ribozymes) demonstrate catalytic activity, linking protein and nucleotide biochemistry. The active site of an enzyme forms a highly specific microenvironment tailored to bind substrates through complementary shape, charge, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions; the induced fit model describes dynamic conformational changes that optimize catalysis. Enzyme kinetics reveal that reaction velocity rises with substrate concentration until active sites saturate at a maximum velocity (Vmax); the Michaelis constant (Km) quantitatively reflects substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity and serves as a comparative measure of affinity. Enzymes are exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions: temperature increases kinetic energy and reaction rates up to an optimal point, after which thermal motion disrupts tertiary structure and causes denaturation; pH alters protonation states of active-site residues and substrates, thereby modulating catalysis and binding. Enzymatic activity is regulated on multiple levels including reversible inhibitors—competitive inhibitors bind the active site and can be outcompeted by substrate concentration, while noncompetitive inhibitors bind allosteric sites to reduce catalytic efficiency—covalent modifications such as phosphorylation that toggle activity states, and availability of cofactors and coenzymes including metal ions and organic carriers like NAD+ and FAD. Feedback inhibition, where an end product of a metabolic pathway allosterically inhibits an upstream enzyme, conserves resources and stabilizes flux. Experimental approaches to study enzymes include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, Lineweaver–Burk plotting for parameter estimation, spectrophotometric assays to monitor substrate depletion or product formation, and mutational analyses to identify catalytic residues. Representative enzymes include DNA polymerases which add nucleotides in a 5′→3′ direction with high fidelity, kinases which transfer phosphate groups, hydrolases like lipases that cleave ester bonds, and oxidoreductases such as dehydrogenases that mediate electron transfers central to respiration and photosynthesis.
