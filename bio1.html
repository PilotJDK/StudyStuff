    <div class="subunit" id="u1-s1">
      <strong>Homeostasis</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Homeostasis is the dynamic process by which multicellular organisms preserve internal conditions within physiologically acceptable limits despite fluctuations in the external environment. This constant regulation allows biochemical systems, particularly enzymes and membrane proteins, to operate efficiently. At the core of homeostasis are three functional components: sensors that detect internal variables such as temperature, pH, osmolarity, and blood gas levels; integrative control centers—primarily neural (hypothalamus, brainstem) and endocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary axes)—that compare sensor input to biologically-determined set points and compute appropriate responses; and effectors, including sweat glands, skeletal muscles, vascular smooth muscle, liver metabolic pathways, and endocrine glands, which implement corrective actions. For example, thermoregulation is achieved through heat-loss mechanisms such as vasodilation and evaporative cooling and heat-conservation mechanisms such as vasoconstriction and shivering thermogenesis. Blood glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated by pancreatic islet hormones: insulin promotes cellular uptake and glycogen synthesis in response to hyperglycemia, whereas glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis during hypoglycemia. The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis illustrates layered endocrine negative feedback where rising thyroid hormones suppress upstream releasing and stimulating hormones to stabilize metabolic rate. Some biological processes use positive feedback for rapid escalation to a defined endpoint; the classic examples are the oxytocin-driven contraction cascade during parturition and platelet activation during thrombosis. Homeostatic control also includes anticipatory adjustments, such as conditioned salivation and circadian modulation of hormone release, and relies on redundancy and overlapping pathways to preserve function; failure or chronic strain on these systems produces pathology, including diabetes mellitus, heart failure, heat stroke, and acid–base disturbances.

      <strong>Biomolecules / Macromolecules</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Biomolecules are organic compounds built primarily from carbon skeletons decorated with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Their chemistry and three-dimensional organization produce the functions required for life. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides like glucose and fructose to complex polysaccharides such as glycogen, starch, cellulose, and chitin. Glucose is central to cellular metabolism; it is catabolized via glycolysis to pyruvate and can enter aerobic pathways for maximal ATP yield. Structural carbohydrates such as cellulose differ from storage polymers by their β-glycosidic linkages, which produce straight, hydrogen-bonded fibrils resistant to most animal digestive enzymes. Lipids form a chemically diverse group defined by hydrophobicity; triglycerides store dense chemical energy in adipose tissue, phospholipids self-assemble into bilayers that create cellular compartments, sterols such as cholesterol modulate membrane fluidity and serve as precursors for steroid hormones, and waxes protect surfaces from water loss. Proteins are polymers of twenty canonical amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The side chain chemistry of amino acids determines local secondary structure such as α-helices and β-sheets through backbone hydrogen bonding and further drives tertiary folding through hydrophobic packing, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and disulfide bridges. Proper folding is critical for function; molecular chaperones assist folding and protect nascent chains under stress. Nucleic acids—DNA and RNA—store and transmit genetic information. DNA's antiparallel double helix forms through complementary base pairing (adenine–thymine via two hydrogen bonds; cytosine–guanine via three hydrogen bonds) and is stabilized by base stacking interactions. RNA, with its ribose sugar and uracil base, adopts single-stranded structures that can fold into catalytic motifs (ribozymes) and mediates translation (mRNA), tRNA-mediated amino acid delivery, and ribosomal function (rRNA). Biochemical reactions building polymers proceed by dehydration synthesis, while hydrolysis returns polymers to monomers; enzymes and regulated pathways catalyze these transitions. The properties of water—polarity, high heat capacity, cohesion, adhesion, and solvent capacity—critically influence macromolecular assembly, reaction rates, and cellular thermoregulation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u1-s3">
      <strong>Enzymes</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions by stabilizing transition states and lowering activation energy barriers, thereby increasing reaction rates without altering reaction equilibria. Although most enzymes are proteins, some RNA molecules (ribozymes) demonstrate catalytic activity, linking protein and nucleotide biochemistry. The active site of an enzyme forms a highly specific microenvironment tailored to bind substrates through complementary shape, charge, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions; the induced fit model describes dynamic conformational changes that optimize catalysis. Enzyme kinetics reveal that reaction velocity rises with substrate concentration until active sites saturate at a maximum velocity (Vmax); the Michaelis constant (Km) quantitatively reflects substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity and serves as a comparative measure of affinity. Enzymes are exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions: temperature increases kinetic energy and reaction rates up to an optimal point, after which thermal motion disrupts tertiary structure and causes denaturation; pH alters protonation states of active-site residues and substrates, thereby modulating catalysis and binding. Enzymatic activity is regulated on multiple levels including reversible inhibitors—competitive inhibitors bind the active site and can be outcompeted by substrate concentration, while noncompetitive inhibitors bind allosteric sites to reduce catalytic efficiency—covalent modifications such as phosphorylation that toggle activity states, and availability of cofactors and coenzymes including metal ions and organic carriers like NAD+ and FAD. Feedback inhibition, where an end product of a metabolic pathway allosterically inhibits an upstream enzyme, conserves resources and stabilizes flux. Experimental approaches to study enzymes include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, Lineweaver–Burk plotting for parameter estimation, spectrophotometric assays to monitor substrate depletion or product formation, and mutational analyses to identify catalytic residues. Representative enzymes include DNA polymerases which add nucleotides in a 5′→3′ direction with high fidelity, kinases which transfer phosphate groups, hydrolases like lipases that cleave ester bonds, and oxidoreductases such as dehydrogenases that mediate electron transfers central to respiration and photosynthesis.

    <h2>Unit 2: Cellular Structure and Function</h2>

    <div class="subunit" id="u2-s1">
      <strong>Cell Theory</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Cell theory is a foundational principle in biology stating that all living organisms are composed of cells, that cells represent the basic structural and functional unit of life, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division. This framework unifies diverse biological phenomena, providing an explanatory model for growth, development, heredity, and tissue maintenance. Cell theory implies that to understand whole-organism physiology, one must understand cellular components and interactions, including how cells obtain energy, replicate genetic material, and interact with each other through junctions and signaling molecules.

    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u2-s2">
      <strong>Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Cells are broadly classified into prokaryotic and eukaryotic types based on organizational complexity. Prokaryotic cells, typified by bacteria and archaea, lack membrane-bound nuclei and organelles; their genetic material is generally organized in a nucleoid, and they often possess a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan or similar polymers, a plasma membrane, ribosomes, and sometimes flagella or pili for motility and adhesion. Eukaryotic cells contain a true nucleus enveloped by a double membrane and multiple membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and—within photosynthetic lineages—chloroplasts. Eukaryotic compartmentalization allows separation of incompatible biochemical processes, spatial regulation of metabolism, and more complex regulation of gene expression. Differences in genome architecture, replication mechanisms, transcriptional control, and cytoskeletal complexity are central to the functional distinctions between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u2-s3">
      <strong>Organelles</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Organelles are membrane-bound subcellular units that carry out specialized functions essential to eukaryotic life. The nucleus houses chromosomal DNA and coordinates gene expression and replication. The endoplasmic reticulum, divided into rough ER studded with ribosomes and smooth ER enriched for lipid synthesis and detoxification, collaborates with the Golgi apparatus to process, modify, and sort proteins and lipids for secretion or internal use. Mitochondria generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and play roles in apoptosis and metabolic signaling; their double-membrane structure and own genome support the endosymbiotic origin hypothesis. Lysosomes and peroxisomes degrade macromolecules and detoxify reactive species respectively. The cytoskeleton—composed of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments—organizes cell shape, mediates intracellular transport, and enables cell movement. Chloroplasts in photosynthetic eukaryotes perform light capture and carbon fixation within a series of membrane compartments and enzyme complexes. Dysfunction or genetic defects in organelles can produce disease phenotypes ranging from mitochondrial myopathies to lysosomal storage disorders.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u2-s4">
      <strong>Cell Differentiation & Specialization</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Cell differentiation arises through differential gene expression orchestrated by transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, signaling gradients, and extracellular cues during development. Pluripotent stem cells can give rise to multiple cell types, while multipotent progenitors are lineage restricted. Differentiation produces specialized cells with unique morphologies and functions—neurons with extended axons and dendrites for electrical signaling, myocytes rich in contractile proteins for force generation, and epithelial cells forming barrier layers with polarized apical–basal surfaces. Cellular specialization enables division of labor in multicellular organisms, and mechanisms such as lateral inhibition, morphogen gradients, and extracellular matrix interactions guide pattern formation and tissue architecture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u2-s5">
      <strong>Lab Safety</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Laboratory safety mitigates physical and biological hazards and is essential for credible experimental outcomes. Safe practice includes correctly handling microscopes to avoid optical damage, using personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, and lab coats, following biosafety levels for work with microbes, disposing of biological and chemical waste according to regulation, and maintaining sterile technique where contamination undermines experiments. Understanding material safety data sheets (MSDS) for chemicals, proper labeling, and emergency procedures for spills or exposures is part of responsible laboratory behavior.

    <h2>Unit 3: DNA and Mitosis</h2>

    <div class="subunit" id="u3-s1">
      <strong>DNA</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the hereditary material in nearly all organisms and is composed of nucleotide monomers each containing a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases. The antiparallel, right-handed double helix structure discovered by Watson and Crick is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between complementary bases and aromatic base stacking interactions. The sequence of nucleotides encodes genes which are transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins. DNA replication is semiconservative: each daughter duplex contains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand; this process is executed by a coordinated set of enzymes including helicase for unwinding, primase for RNA primer synthesis, DNA polymerases for elongation, and ligase for joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. Proofreading and repair pathways—such as mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair—preserve genomic integrity; their failure leads to mutation accumulation and disease.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u3-s2">
      <strong>Cell Cycle</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        The eukaryotic cell cycle is a cyclic series of phases that includes gap phases (G1 and G2), S-phase where DNA replication occurs, and M-phase encompassing mitosis and cytokinesis. Precise molecular checkpoints (G1/S, G2/M, and the spindle assembly checkpoint) evaluate DNA integrity and proper chromosomal attachment before progression. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory cyclin partners orchestrate transitions between phases through phosphorylation cascades. Mitosis itself is subdivided into prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase during which duplicated chromosomes condense, align at the metaphase plate, separate as sister chromatids, and are distributed to daughter nuclei, followed by physical cell division. Disruption of cell-cycle control—via oncogene activation or tumor-suppressor loss—can produce unchecked proliferation and cancer; many chemotherapy agents target rapidly dividing cells by interfering with DNA synthesis or mitotic spindle function.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u3-s3">
      <strong>Biotechnology</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Biotechnology encompasses techniques that manipulate biological systems and genetic material for practical applications. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies DNA fragments exponentially, enabling diagnostics and sequencing. Gel electrophoresis separates nucleic acids by size for analysis and cloning. Recombinant DNA technologies, including restriction enzyme digestion and ligation into plasmid vectors, permit gene cloning and expression in host organisms. CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized targeted genomic editing with programmable sequence specificity, enabling gene knockout, knock-in, and precise base editing. Biotechnological tools produce genetically modified crops for improved yield and resistance, transgenic animals for research and biopharmaceutical production, and forensic DNA profiling for identification. Ethical, regulatory, and ecological considerations accompany the deployment of these technologies.

    <h2>Unit 4: Cell Transport and Energy</h2>

    <div class="subunit" id="u4-s1">
      <strong>Plasma Membrane</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        The plasma membrane is a dynamic, selectively permeable boundary that separates a cell's interior from its environment. It is comprised primarily of amphipathic phospholipids that form a bilayer, interspersed with proteins that serve as channels, carriers, receptors, enzymes, and structural anchors. Cholesterol molecules within animal membranes modulate fluidity over temperature ranges. Membrane carbohydrates conjugated to lipids and proteins contribute to cell recognition and signaling. Membrane asymmetry, lateral mobility of components, and specialized microdomains such as lipid rafts are important for organizing signaling complexes and trafficking pathways. The membrane's selective permeability and active transport systems maintain ionic gradients (notably Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺) essential for nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and secondary active transport of nutrients.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u4-s2">
      <strong>Transport</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Transport across biological membranes occurs by passive and active mechanisms. Passive transport does not require cellular energy and includes simple diffusion of small nonpolar molecules, facilitated diffusion through protein channels and carriers for ions and polar solutes, and osmosis, the net flow of water across semipermeable membranes driven by solute concentration differences. Active transport uses metabolic energy (usually ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradients via pumps such as the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and proton pumps that generate electrochemical gradients. Secondary active transport harnesses preexisting gradients to drive coupled transport of other molecules, exemplified by glucose–Na⁺ symporters. Endocytosis and exocytosis mediate bulk transport of macromolecules and particles, with receptor-mediated endocytosis providing specificity for uptake of ligands such as LDL particles.

    <div class="subunit" id="u4-s3">
      <strong>Photosynthesis & Respiration</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary processes that transfer energy in ecosystems. Photosynthesis in chloroplasts captures photons to drive electron transport and generate reducing power and ATP during the light reactions; the Calvin cycle then fixes atmospheric CO₂ into organic sugars. Cellular respiration in mitochondria oxidizes glucose and other organic substrates, channeling electrons through glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid (Krebs) cycle, and the electron transport chain to synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Anaerobic metabolism provides alternative pathways—such as lactic acid fermentation in animal cells and alcoholic fermentation in yeast—that regenerate NAD+ for glycolysis under low-oxygen conditions, albeit with lower ATP yield. The coupling of redox chemistry, proton motive force, and ATP synthase underlies bioenergetics across life.

    <div class="subunit" id="u4-s4">
      <strong>Bioenergetics</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Bioenergetics applies thermodynamic concepts to living systems, examining how organisms capture, convert, store, and dissipate energy. Free energy changes (ΔG) determine whether biochemical reactions proceed spontaneously; cells use coupling strategies—such as ATP hydrolysis—to drive endergonic reactions. Metabolic pathways are organized into networks with regulatory nodes controlling flux in response to nutrient availability, energy demand, and hormonal signals. Concepts such as oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, substrate-level phosphorylation, and metabolic flexibility (switching between carbohydrate, fat, and protein fuels) are central to organismal physiology and adaptation.

    <div class="subunit" id="u5-s1">
      <strong>Cycles</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Biogeochemical cycles describe the movement and transformation of chemical elements through the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. The water cycle circulates water via evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff, shaping climate and supporting life. The carbon cycle interlinks photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion, determining atmospheric CO₂ levels and influencing global climate. The nitrogen cycle depends on microbial processes—nitrogen fixation converts N₂ to bioavailable forms, nitrification oxidizes ammonia to nitrate, and denitrification returns nitrogen to the atmosphere. The phosphorus cycle involves weathering of minerals and sedimentary transport and is often a limiting nutrient in aquatic ecosystems. Human activities, including fossil fuel combustion and intensive agriculture, have altered the balance of these cycles, contributing to climate change, eutrophication, and loss of ecosystem services.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u5-s2">
      <strong>Ecosystems</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Ecosystems are functional units where organisms interact with each other and their physical environment. Energy enters ecosystems through primary producers that convert sunlight into chemical energy and flows through consumers and decomposers via trophic interactions. Energy transfer is inefficient, with only a fraction of energy passed between trophic levels, which shapes ecosystem structure and biomass pyramids. Ecosystem dynamics are influenced by abiotic factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil composition, and disturbance regimes, as well as biotic factors like competition, predation, mutualisms, and disease. Landscape ecology examines how spatial patterns, fragmentation, and connectivity affect populations and community resilience.

    <div class="subunit" id="u5-s3">
      <strong>Human Impact</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Human activity has transformed natural systems through habitat conversion, pollution, overexploitation of resources, introduction of invasive species, and greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. Deforestation reduces carbon sinks and biodiversity, agricultural runoff causes eutrophication in aquatic systems, and urbanization fragments habitats, isolating populations. Conservation biology uses principles of population ecology, genetics, and ecosystem management to mitigate these impacts through protected areas, restoration ecology, sustainable resource management, and species recovery programs.

      <strong>DNA Biotechnology</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Modern DNA biotechnology integrates molecular tools to analyze, modify, and apply genetic information. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enables selective amplification of DNA sequences for diagnostics and cloning, while gel electrophoresis separates nucleic acids or proteins by size and charge to visualize outcomes. DNA sequencing technologies—from Sanger sequencing to next-generation platforms—reveal base-level genomic information used in research, medicine, and forensics. Recombinant DNA methods facilitate insertion of genes into plasmids and expression in host organisms, enabling production of therapeutic proteins, vaccines, and genetically-engineered crops. Newer precise genome-editing systems, such as CRISPR-Cas, allow targeted edits for functional genomics and potential therapeutic correction of genetic disease, prompting ethical and regulatory considerations.

    <div class="subunit" id="u6-s2">
      <strong>Protein Synthesis</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Protein synthesis proceeds through coordinated transcription and translation. During transcription, RNA polymerase binds promoter sequences and synthesizes a complementary pre-mRNA strand from a DNA template; eukaryotic transcripts undergo capping, splicing to excise introns, and polyadenylation to produce mature mRNA exported to the cytoplasm. Ribosomes translate mRNA codons using tRNAs charged with specific amino acids; the ribosomal machinery ensures fidelity through codon–anticodon pairing and proofreading steps. Co-translational and post-translational folding and modifications—such as disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic cleavage—determine final protein structure, localization, and activity. Misfolding can be deleterious and is implicated in disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Alzheimer's disease.

    </div>

    <div class="subunit" id="u6-s3">
      <strong>Meiosis</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Meiosis is a specialized division producing haploid gametes from diploid progenitors and increasing genetic variation through two successive division phases and homologous recombination. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material by crossing over, forming chiasmata that increase allelic shuffling. Independent assortment of homologs during metaphase I generates additional combinatorial diversity. Errors such as nondisjunction during meiosis can produce aneuploid gametes leading to syndromes like trisomy 21. Meiosis underpins sexual reproduction, facilitating genetic novelty on which natural selection can act.

      <strong>DNA Mutations</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Mutations alter DNA sequences and range from single-base substitutions to large chromosomal rearrangements. Point mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense, affecting protein coding to varying degrees; insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three nucleotides produce frameshifts that often abrogate protein function. Mutations arise from replication errors, chemical mutagens, ultraviolet radiation, and mobile genetic elements, and cells possess repair systems—base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and double-strand break repair—to correct damage. While many mutations are neutral or deleterious, some provide adaptive advantages and contribute to evolutionary change; mutation rates and mechanisms are also exploited in experimental evolution and directed mutagenesis.

      <strong>Genetics Basics</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Mendelian genetics describes inheritance patterns where alleles segregate and assort independently, producing predictable genotypic and phenotypic ratios in crosses. However, real-world inheritance includes non-Mendelian patterns: incomplete dominance yields intermediate phenotypes, codominance allows simultaneous expression of both alleles, and multiple alleles (such as ABO blood groups) expand genotype possibilities. Sex-linked traits, often borne on the X chromosome, exhibit different patterns of inheritance between males and females due to hemizygosity. Modern genetics integrates molecular understanding of gene expression, regulatory sequences, epigenetics, and gene-by-environment interactions to explain complex traits.

        Pedigree analysis traces traits across generations to infer modes of inheritance and calculate carrier probabilities. Polygenic traits, influenced by many genes of small effect and environmental modulation, produce continuous variation exemplified by height, skin pigmentation, and susceptibility to complex diseases. Quantitative genetics uses statistical models to partition phenotypic variance into genetic and environmental components and to estimate heritability.

      <strong>Cell Cycle & Reproduction</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Sexual reproduction depends on meiosis to produce haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization to restore diploidy in the zygote. Terminology such as haploid and diploid describes chromosome number, while genotype and phenotype differentiate genetic constitution from observable traits. Nondisjunction and other meiotic errors can cause aneuploidies, and mechanisms such as crossing over and independent assortment increase offspring genetic diversity.

        Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of individuals due to heritable variation in traits that influence survival and reproduction. Traits that confer advantages—such as camouflage, efficient metabolism, or resistance to pathogens—tend to increase in frequency over generations. Selection can be stabilizing, directional, or disruptive, and interacts with genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, and recombination to shape population genetics. Evolutionary responses to selection can be rapid in some contexts, producing observable changes in a few generations such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria or pesticide resistance in insects.

      <strong>Evolution Concepts</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Evolutionary theory explains the diversity of life through descent with modification from common ancestors. The endosymbiotic theory posits that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as free-living bacteria that established symbioses within ancestral eukaryotic cells, a transition supported by organelle genomes and double membranes. Phylogenetics uses molecular and morphological data to infer evolutionary relationships and build cladograms and phylogenetic trees that hypothesize branching patterns of descent. The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) represents an inferred ancient lineage from which extant life diverged. Historical figures such as Charles Darwin articulated natural selection as a mechanism of evolution, while earlier thinkers like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed alternative models now largely superseded but historically important. Modern synthesis integrates evolutionary biology with genetics, paleontology, and molecular biology.

      <strong>Isolation Mechanisms</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Speciation arises when populations become reproductively isolated and diverge genetically. Isolation mechanisms include geographic barriers that physically separate populations (allopatric speciation), behavioral differences such as mating calls that prevent interbreeding (behavioral isolation), temporal separation of breeding times, and mechanical or gametic incompatibilities that prevent fertilization. Speciation can be rapid under strong selection or gradual under weaker forces and often involves accumulation of genetic differences that reduce gene flow.

      <strong>Evidence of Evolution</strong>
      <p class="micro">
        Multiple lines of evidence support evolutionary theory. The fossil record preserves transitional forms that reveal morphological changes through time and document ancient ecosystems. Comparative anatomy highlights homologous structures—similarities due to shared ancestry—contrasted with analogous structures that evolved convergently in unrelated lineages. Molecular biology reveals genetic homologies and conserved sequences across taxa, while embryology shows conserved developmental stages. Biogeographic distributions reflect historical vicariance and dispersal events, and experimental evolution demonstrates adaptive changes in controlled settings. Together, these approaches construct a robust, testable framework for understanding biological change.
